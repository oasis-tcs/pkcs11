table: ChaCha20 Mechanisms vs. Functions

### Definitions

This section defines the key type “**CKK_CHACHA20**” for type **CK_KEY_TYPE** as
used in the **CKA_KEY_TYPE** attribute of key objects.

Mechanisms:

- CKM_CHACHA20_KEY_GEN
- CKM_CHACHA20

### ChaCha20 secret key objects

ChaCha20 secret key objects (object class **CKO_SECRET_KEY**, key type
**CKK_CHACHA20**) hold ChaCha20 keys. The following table defines the ChaCha20
secret key object attributes, in addition to the common attributes defined for
this object class:

| Attribute           | Data type  | Meaning                                 |
|---------------------|------------|-----------------------------------------|
| CKA_VALUE ^1,4,6,7^ | Byte array | Key length is fixed at 256 bits. Bit length restricted to a byte array. |
| CKA_VALUE_LEN ^2,3^ | CK_ULONG   | Length in bytes of key value            |
table: ChaCha20 Secret Key Object

The following is a sample template for creating a ChaCha20 secret key object:

~~~{.c}
CK_OBJECT_CLASS class = CKO_SECRET_KEY;
CK_KEY_TYPE keyType = CKK_CHACHA20;
CK_UTF8CHAR label[] = “A ChaCha20 secret key object”;
CK_BYTE value[32] = {...};
CK_BBOOL true = CK_TRUE;
CK_ATTRIBUTE template[] = {
  {CKA_CLASS, &class, sizeof(class)},
  {CKA_KEY_TYPE, &keyType, sizeof(keyType)},
  {CKA_TOKEN, &true, sizeof(true)},
  {CKA_LABEL, label, sizeof(label)-1},
  {CKA_ENCRYPT, &true, sizeof(true)},
  {CKA_VALUE, value, sizeof(value)}
};
~~~

**CKA_CHECK_VALUE**: The value of this attribute is derived from the key object
by taking the first three bytes of the SHA-1 hash of the ChaCha20 secret key
object’s **CKA_VALUE** attribute.

### ChaCha20 mechanism parameters

* **CK_CHACHA20_PARAMS; CK_CHACHA20_PARAMS_PTR**

**CK_CHACHA20_PARAMS** provides the parameters to the **CKM_CHACHA20**
mechanism. It is defined as follows:

~~~{.c}
typedef struct CK_CHACHA20_PARAMS {
	CK_BYTE_PTR	pBlockCounter;
	CK_ULONG	blockCounterBits;
	CK_BYTE_PTR	pNonce;
	CK_ULONG	ulNonceBits;
} CK_CHACHA20_PARAMS;
~~~

The fields of the structure have the following meanings:

_pBlockCounter_
: pointer to block counter

_ulblockCounterBits_
: length of block counter in bits (can be either 32 or 64)

_pNonce_
: nonce (This should be never re-used with the same key.)

_ulNonceBits_
: length of nonce in bits (is 64 for original, 96 for IETF and 192 for xchacha20
  variant)

The block counter is used to address 512 bit blocks in the stream. In certain
settings (e.g. disk encryption) it is necessary to address these blocks in
random order, thus this counter is exposed here.

**CK_CHACHA20_PARAMS_PTR** is a pointer to **CK_CHACHA20_PARAMS**.

### ChaCha20 key generation

The ChaCha20 key generation mechanism, denoted **CKM_CHACHA20_KEY_GEN**, is a
key generation mechanism for ChaCha20.

It does not have a parameter.

The mechanism generates ChaCha20 keys of 256 bits.

The mechanism contributes the **CKA_CLASS**, **CKA_KEY_TYPE**, and **CKA_VALUE**
attributes to the new key. Other attributes supported by the key type
(specifically, the flags indicating which functions the key supports) may be
specified in the template for the key, or else are assigned default initial
values.

For this mechanism, the _ulMinKeySize_ and _ulMaxKeySize_ fields of the
**CK_MECHANISM_INFO** structure specify the supported range of key sizes in
bytes. As a practical matter, the key size for ChaCha20 is fixed at 256 bits.

### ChaCha20 mechanism

ChaCha20, denoted **CKM_CHACHA20**, is a mechanism for single and multiple-part
encryption and decryption based on the ChaCha20 stream cipher. It comes in 3
variants, which only differ in the size and handling of their nonces, affecting
the safety of using random nonces and the maximum size that can be encrypted
safely.

Chacha20 has a parameter, **CK_CHACHA20_PARAMS**, which indicates the nonce and
initial block counter value.

Constraints on key types and the length of input and output data are summarized
in the following table:

| Function  | Key type     | Input length         | Output length | Comments |
|-----------|--------------|----------------------|---------------|----------|
| C_Encrypt | CKK_CHACHA20 | Any / only up to 256 GB in case of IETF variant | Same as input length | No final part |
| C_Decrypt | CKK_CHACHA20 | Any / only up to 256 GB in case of IETF variant | Same as input length | No final part |
table: ChaCha20: Key and Data Length

For this mechanism, the ulMinKeySize and ulMaxKeySize fields of the
**CK_MECHANISM_INFO** structure specify the supported range of ChaCha20 key
sizes, in bits.

| Variant   | Nonce   | Block counter | Maximum message | Nonce generation   |
|-----------|---------|--------|------------------------|--------------------|
| original  | 64 bit  | 64 bit | Virtually unlimited | 1^st^ msg: nonce~0~=random |
|           |         |        |                     | n^th^ msg: nonce~n-1~++ |
| IETF      | 96 bit  | 32 bit | Max ~256 GB         | 1^st^ msg: nonce~0~=random |
|           |         |        |                     | n^th^ msg: nonce~n-1~++ |
| XChaCha20 | 192 bit | 64 bit | Virtually unlimited | Each nonce can be randomly generated. |
table: ChaCha20: Nonce and block counter lengths

Nonces must not ever be reused with the same key. However due to the birthday
paradox the first two variants cannot guarantee that randomly generated nonces
are never repeating. Thus the recommended way to handle this is to generate the
first nonce randomly, then increase this for follow-up messages. Only the last
(XChaCha20) has large enough nonces so that it is virtually impossible to
trigger with randomly generated nonces the birthday paradox.
