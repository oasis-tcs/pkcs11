## Common attributes

-----  -------------------------------------------------------------------
  ^1^  MUST be specified when object is created with **C_CreateObject**.
  ^2^  MUST not be specified when object is created with
       **C_CreateObject**.
  ^3^  MUST be specified when object is generated with **C_GenerateKey**
       or **C_GenerateKeyPair**.
  ^4^  MUST not be specified when object is generated with
       **C_GenerateKey** or **C_GenerateKeyPair**.
  ^5^  MUST be specified when object is unwrapped with **C_UnwrapKey**.
  ^6^  MUST not be specified when object is unwrapped with
       **C_UnwrapKey**.
  ^7^  Cannot be revealed if object has its **CKA_SENSITIVE** attribute
       set to CK_TRUE or its **CKA_EXTRACTABLE** attribute set to
       CK_FALSE.
  ^8^  May be modified after object is created with a
       **C_SetAttributeValue** call, or in the process of copying object
       with a **C_CopyObject** call. However, it is possible that a
       particular token may not permit modification of the attribute
       during the course of a **C_CopyObject** call.
  ^9^  Default value is token-specific, and may depend on the values of
       other attributes.
 ^10^  Can only be set to CK_TRUE by the SO user.
 ^11^  Attribute cannot be changed once set to CK_TRUE. It becomes a read
       only attribute.
 ^12^  Attribute cannot be changed once set to CK_FALSE. It becomes a read
       only attribute.
 ^13^  Attribute is generated by the module with **C_GenerateKeyPair**.
