## Common attributes

Objects are identified by two main attributess the should be present on every
object, **CKA_CLASS** and **CKA_UNIQUE_ID**. Each Object class further defines
which attibutes are mandatory or optional for objects of that class, se further
sections for additional details.

The following table provides footnotes used through the document that specify
how attributes should be handle by tokens

-----  -------------------------------------------------------------------
  ^1^  MUST be specified when object is created with **C_CreateObject**.
  ^2^  MUST not be specified when object is created with
       **C_CreateObject**.
  ^3^  MUST be specified when object is generated with **C_GenerateKey**
       or **C_GenerateKeyPair**.
  ^4^  MUST not be specified when object is generated with
       **C_GenerateKey** or **C_GenerateKeyPair**.
  ^5^  MUST be specified when object is unwrapped with **C_UnwrapKey**.
  ^6^  MUST not be specified when object is unwrapped with
       **C_UnwrapKey**.
  ^7^  Cannot be revealed if object has its **CKA_SENSITIVE** attribute
       set to CK_TRUE or its **CKA_EXTRACTABLE** attribute set to
       CK_FALSE.
  ^8^  May be modified after object is created with a
       **C_SetAttributeValue** call, or in the process of copying object
       with a **C_CopyObject** call. However, it is possible that a
       particular token may not permit modification of the attribute
       during the course of a **C_CopyObject** call.
  ^9^  Default value is token-specific, and may depend on the values of
       other attributes.
 ^10^  Can only be set to CK_TRUE by the SO user.
 ^11^  Attribute cannot be changed once set to CK_TRUE. It becomes a read
       only attribute.
 ^12^  Attribute cannot be changed once set to CK_FALSE. It becomes a read
       only attribute.
 ^13^  Attribute is generated by the module with **C_GenerateKeyPair**.

### The CKA_CLASS attribute

The **CKA_CLASS** attribute is a value of type **CK_OBJECT_CLASS** that
identifies the object class (type) of the object.


### The CKA_UNIQUE_ID attribute

Any time a new object is created, a value for **CKA_UNIQUE_ID MUST** be
generated by the token and stored with the object. The specific algorithm used
to generate unique ID values for objects is token-specific, but values generated
MUST be unique across all objects visible to any particular session, and SHOULD
be unique across all objects created by the token. Reinitializing the token,
such as by calling **C_InitToken**, MAY cause reuse of **CKA_UNIQUE_ID** values.

Any attempt to modify the **CKA_UNIQUE_ID** attribute of an existing object or
to specify the value of the **CKA_UNIQUE_ID** attribute in the template for an
operation that creates one or more objects MUST fail. Operations failing for
this reason return the error code **CKR_ATTRIBUTE_READ_ONLY**.

The following table defines the attributes common to all objects.

| Attribute             | Data Type       | Meaning             |
|-----------------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| CKA_CLASS^1^          | CK_OBJECT_CLASS | Object class (type) |
| CKA_UNIQUE_ID ^2,4,6^ | RFC2279 string  | The unique identifier assigned to the object. |
