## Disclaimer concerning sample code

For the remainder of this section, we enumerate the various functions defined in
Cryptoki. Most functions will be shown in use in at least one sample code
snippet. For the sake of brevity, sample code will frequently be somewhat
incomplete. In particular, sample code will generally ignore possible error
returns from C library functions, and also will not deal with Cryptoki error
returns in a realistic fashion.
