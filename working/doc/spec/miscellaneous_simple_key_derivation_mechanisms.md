### Parameters for miscellaneous simple key derivation mechanisms

#### CK_KEY_DERIVATION_STRING_DATA
\  

**CK_KEY_DERIVATION_STRING_DATA** provides the parameters for the
**CKM_CONCATENATE_BASE_AND_DATA**, **CKM_CONCATENATE_DATA_AND_BASE**, and
**CKM_XOR_BASE_AND_DATA** mechanisms. It is defined as follows:

~~~{.c}
typedef struct CK_KEY_DERIVATION_STRING_DATA {
  CK_BYTE_PTR pData;
  CK_ULONG ulLen;
} CK_KEY_DERIVATION_STRING_DATA;
~~~

The fields of the structure have the following meanings:

_pData_
: pointer to the byte string

_ulLen_
: length of the byte string

**CK_KEY_DERIVATION_STRING_DATA_PTR** is a pointer to a **CK_KEY_DERIVATION_STRING_DATA**.

#### CK_EXTRACT_PARAMS
\  

**CK_EXTRACT_PARAMS** provides the parameter to the **CKM_EXTRACT_KEY_FROM_KEY**
mechanism. It specifies which bit of the base key should be used as the first
bit of the derived key. It is defined as follows:

~~~{.c}
typedef CK_ULONG CK_EXTRACT_PARAMS;
~~~

**CK_EXTRACT_PARAMS_PTR** is a pointer to a **CK_EXTRACT_PARAMS**.

### Concatenation of a base key and another key

This mechanism, denoted **CKM_CONCATENATE_BASE_AND_KEY**, derives a secret key
from the concatenation of two existing secret keys. The two keys are specified
by handles; the values of the keys specified are concatenated together in a
buffer.

This mechanism takes a parameter, a **CK_OBJECT_HANDLE**. This handle produces
the key value information which is appended to the end of the base key’s value
information (the base key is the key whose handle is supplied as an argument to
C_DeriveKey).

For example, if the value of the base key is 0x01234567, and the value of the
other key is 0x89ABCDEF, then the value of the derived key will be taken from a
buffer containing the string 0x0123456789ABCDEF. 

- If no length or key type is provided in the template, then the key produced by
  this mechanism will be a generic secret key. Its length will be equal to the
  sum of the lengths of the values of the two original keys.
- If no key type is provided in the template, but a length is, then the key
  produced by this mechanism will be a generic secret key of the specified
  length.
- If no length is provided in the template, but a key type is, then that key
  type must have a well-defined length. If it does, then the key produced by
  this mechanism will be of the type specified in the template. If it doesn’t,
  an error will be returned.
- If both a key type and a length are provided in the template, the length must
  be compatible with that key type. The key produced by this mechanism will be
  of the specified type and length.

If a DES, DES2, DES3, or CDMF key is derived with this mechanism, the parity
bits of the key will be set properly.

If the requested type of key requires more bytes than are available by
concatenating the two original keys’ values, an error is generated.

This mechanism has the following rules about key sensitivity and extractability:

- If either of the two original keys has its **CKA_SENSITIVE** attribute set to
  CK_TRUE, so does the derived key. If not, then the derived key’s
  **CKA_SENSITIVE** attribute is set either from the supplied template or from a
  default value.
- Similarly, if either of the two original keys has its **CKA_EXTRACTABLE**
  attribute set to CK_FALSE, so does the derived key. If not, then the derived
  key’s **CKA_EXTRACTABLE** attribute is set either from the supplied template
  or from a default value.
- The derived key’s **CKA_ALWAYS_SENSITIVE** attribute is set to CK_TRUE if and
  only if both of the original keys have their **CKA_ALWAYS_SENSITIVE**
  attributes set to CK_TRUE.
- Similarly, the derived key’s **CKA_NEVER_EXTRACTABLE** attribute is set to
  CK_TRUE if and only if both of the original keys have their
  **CKA_NEVER_EXTRACTABLE** attributes set to CK_TRUE.

### Concatenation of a base key and data

This mechanism, denoted **CKM_CONCATENATE_BASE_AND_DATA**, derives a secret key
by concatenating data onto the end of a specified secret key.

This mechanism takes a parameter, a **CK_KEY_DERIVATION_STRING_DATA** structure,
which specifies the length and value of the data which will be appended to the
base key to derive another key.

For example, if the value of the base key is 0x01234567, and the value of the
data is 0x89ABCDEF, then the value of the derived key will be taken from a
buffer containing the string 0x0123456789ABCDEF. 

- If no length or key type is provided in the template, then the key produced by
  this mechanism will be a generic secret key. Its length will be equal to the
  sum of the lengths of the value of the original key and the data.
- If no key type is provided in the template, but a length is, then the key
  produced by this mechanism will be a generic secret key of the specified
  length.
- If no length is provided in the template, but a key type is, then that key
  type must have a well-defined length. If it does, then the key produced by
  this mechanism will be of the type specified in the template. If it doesn’t,
  an error will be returned.
- If both a key type and a length are provided in the template, the length must
  be compatible with that key type. The key produced by this mechanism will be
  of the specified type and length.

If a DES, DES2, DES3, or CDMF key is derived with this mechanism, the parity
bits of the key will be set properly.

If the requested type of key requires more bytes than are available by
concatenating the original key’s value and the data, an error is generated.

This mechanism has the following rules about key sensitivity and extractability:

- If the base key has its **CKA_SENSITIVE** attribute set to CK_TRUE, so does
  the derived key. If not, then the derived key’s **CKA_SENSITIVE** attribute is
  set either from the supplied template or from a default value.
- Similarly, if the base key has its **CKA_EXTRACTABLE** attribute set to
  CK_FALSE, so does the derived key. If not, then the derived key’s
  **CKA_EXTRACTABLE** attribute is set either from the supplied template or from
  a default value.
- The derived key’s **CKA_ALWAYS_SENSITIVE** attribute is set to CK_TRUE if and
  only if the base key has its **CKA_ALWAYS_SENSITIVE** attribute set to
  CK_TRUE.
- Similarly, the derived key’s **CKA_NEVER_EXTRACTABLE** attribute is set to
  CK_TRUE if and only if the base key has its **CKA_NEVER_EXTRACTABLE**
  attribute set to CK_TRUE.

### Concatenation of data and a base key

This mechanism, denoted **CKM_CONCATENATE_DATA_AND_BASE**, derives a secret key
by prepending data to the start of a specified secret key.

This mechanism takes a parameter, a **CK_KEY_DERIVATION_STRING_DATA** structure,
which specifies the length and value of the data which will be prepended to the
base key to derive another key.

For example, if the value of the base key is 0x01234567, and the value of the
data is 0x89ABCDEF, then the value of the derived key will be taken from a
buffer containing the string 0x89ABCDEF01234567. 

- If no length or key type is provided in the template, then the key produced by
  this mechanism will be a generic secret key. Its length will be equal to the
  sum of the lengths of the data and the value of the original key.
- If no key type is provided in the template, but a length is, then the key
  produced by this mechanism will be a generic secret key of the specified
  length.
- If no length is provided in the template, but a key type is, then that key
  type must have a well-defined length. If it does, then the key produced by
  this mechanism will be of the type specified in the template. If it doesn’t,
  an error will be returned.
- If both a key type and a length are provided in the template, the length must
  be compatible with that key type. The key produced by this mechanism will be
  of the specified type and length.

If a DES, DES2, DES3, or CDMF key is derived with this mechanism, the parity
bits of the key will be set properly.

If the requested type of key requires more bytes than are available by
concatenating the data and the original key’s value, an error is generated.

This mechanism has the following rules about key sensitivity and extractability:

- If the base key has its **CKA_SENSITIVE** attribute set to CK_TRUE, so does
  the derived key. If not, then the derived key’s **CKA_SENSITIVE** attribute is
  set either from the supplied template or from a default value.
- Similarly, if the base key has its **CKA_EXTRACTABLE** attribute set to
  CK_FALSE, so does the derived key. If not, then the derived key’s
  **CKA_EXTRACTABLE** attribute is set either from the supplied template or from
  a default value.
- The derived key’s **CKA_ALWAYS_SENSITIVE** attribute is set to CK_TRUE if and
  only if the base key has its **CKA_ALWAYS_SENSITIVE** attribute set to
  CK_TRUE.
- Similarly, the derived key’s **CKA_NEVER_EXTRACTABLE** attribute is set to
  CK_TRUE if and only if the base key has its **CKA_NEVER_EXTRACTABLE**
  attribute set to CK_TRUE.

### XORing of a key and data

XORing key derivation, denoted **CKM_XOR_BASE_AND_DATA**, is a mechanism which
provides the capability of deriving a secret key by performing a bit XORing of a
key pointed to by a base key handle and some data.

This mechanism takes a parameter, a **CK_KEY_DERIVATION_STRING_DATA** structure,
which specifies the data with which to XOR the original key’s value.

For example, if the value of the base key is 0x01234567, and the value of the
data is 0x89ABCDEF, then the value of the derived key will be taken from a
buffer containing the string 0x88888888.

- If no length or key type is provided in the template, then the key produced by
  this mechanism will be a generic secret key. Its length will be equal to the
  minimum of the lengths of the data and the value of the original key.
- If no key type is provided in the template, but a length is, then the key
  produced by this mechanism will be a generic secret key of the specified
  length.
- If no length is provided in the template, but a key type is, then that key
  type must have a well-defined length. If it does, then the key produced by
  this mechanism will be of the type specified in the template. If it doesn’t,
  an error will be returned.
- If both a key type and a length are provided in the template, the length must
  be compatible with that key type. The key produced by this mechanism will be
  of the specified type and length.

If a DES, DES2, DES3, or CDMF key is derived with this mechanism, the parity
bits of the key will be set properly.

If the requested type of key requires more bytes than are available by taking
the shorter of the data and the original key’s value, an error is generated.

This mechanism has the following rules about key sensitivity and extractability:

- If the base key has its **CKA_SENSITIVE** attribute set to CK_TRUE, so does
  the derived key. If not, then the derived key’s **CKA_SENSITIVE** attribute is
  set either from the supplied template or from a default value.
- Similarly, if the base key has its **CKA_EXTRACTABLE** attribute set to
  CK_FALSE, so does the derived key. If not, then the derived key’s
  **CKA_EXTRACTABLE** attribute is set either from the supplied template or from
  a default value.
- The derived key’s **CKA_ALWAYS_SENSITIVE** attribute is set to CK_TRUE if and
  only if the base key has its **CKA_ALWAYS_SENSITIVE** attribute set to
  CK_TRUE.
- Similarly, the derived key’s **CKA_NEVER_EXTRACTABLE** attribute is set to
  CK_TRUE if and only if the base key has its **CKA_NEVER_EXTRACTABLE**
  attribute set to CK_TRUE.

### Extraction of one key from another key

Extraction of one key from another key, denoted **CKM_EXTRACT_KEY_FROM_KEY**, is
a mechanism which provides the capability of creating one secret key from the
bits of another secret key.

This mechanism has a parameter, a **CK_EXTRACT_PARAMS**, which specifies which
bit of the original key should be used as the first bit of the newly-derived
key.

We give an example of how this mechanism works. Suppose a token has a secret key
with the 4-byte value 0x329F84A9. We will derive a 2-byte secret key from this
key, starting at bit position 21 (i.e., the value of the parameter to the
**CKM_EXTRACT_KEY_FROM_KEY** mechanism is 21).

#. We write the key’s value in binary: 0011 0010 1001 1111 1000 0100 1010 1001.
   We regard this binary string as holding the 32 bits of the key, labeled as
   b0, b1, …, b31.
#. We then extract 16 consecutive bits (i.e., 2 bytes) from this binary string,
   starting at bit b21. We obtain the binary string 1001 0101 0010 0110.
#. The value of the new key is thus 0x9526.

Note that when constructing the value of the derived key, it is permissible to
wrap around the end of the binary string representing the original key’s value.

If the original key used in this process is sensitive, then the derived key must
also be sensitive for the derivation to succeed.

- If no length or key type is provided in the template, then an error will be
  returned.
- If no key type is provided in the template, but a length is, then the key
  produced by this mechanism will be a generic secret key of the specified
  length.
- If no length is provided in the template, but a key type is, then that key
  type must have a well-defined length. If it does, then the key produced by
  this mechanism will be of the type specified in the template. If it doesn’t,
  an error will be returned.
- If both a key type and a length are provided in the template, the length must
  be compatible with that key type. The key produced by this mechanism will be
  of the specified type and length.

If a DES, DES2, DES3, or CDMF key is derived with this mechanism, the parity
bits of the key will be set properly.

If the requested type of key requires more bytes than the original key has, an
error is generated.

This mechanism has the following rules about key sensitivity and extractability:

- If the base key has its **CKA_SENSITIVE** attribute set to CK_TRUE, so does
  the derived key. If not, then the derived key’s **CKA_SENSITIVE** attribute is
  set either from the supplied template or from a default value.
- Similarly, if the base key has its **CKA_EXTRACTABLE** attribute set to
  CK_FALSE, so does the derived key. If not, then the derived key’s
  **CKA_EXTRACTABLE** attribute is set either from the supplied template or from
  a default value.
- The derived key’s **CKA_ALWAYS_SENSITIVE** attribute is set to CK_TRUE if and
  only if the base key has its **CKA_ALWAYS_SENSITIVE** attribute set to
  CK_TRUE.
- Similarly, the derived key’s **CKA_NEVER_EXTRACTABLE** attribute is set to
  CK_TRUE if and only if the base key has its **CKA_NEVER_EXTRACTABLE**
  attribute set to CK_TRUE.
            
### Public key from private key

Public key from private key, denoted **CKM_PUB_KEY_FROM_PRIV_KEY**, is a
mechanism which creates a matching public key from an existing private key. This
mechanism takes no parameters. The public key matches the private key’s type,
and all the key specific parameters are generated by the mechanism. If the
following parameters are not set in the template, they will default as follows:

#. CKA_TOKEN – CK_FALSE
#. CKA_PRIVATE – CK_FALSE
#. CKA_MODIFIABLE – CK_TRUE
#. CKA_LOCAL – CK_FALSE
#. CKA_SENSITIVE – CK_FALSE
#. CKA_ALWAYS_SENSITIVE – CK_FALSE
#. CKA_EXTRACTABLE – CK_TRUE
#. CKA_NEVER_EXTRACTABLE – CK_FALSE
#. CKA_COPYABLE – CK_TRUE
#. CKA_DESTROYABLE - CK_FALSE
#. CKA_LABEL – NULL
#. CKA_WRAP_TEMPLATE - empty
#. CKA_ENCRYPT – to CKA_DECRYPT of the private key
#. CKA_VERIFY – to CKA_SIGN of the private key
#. CKA_VERIFY_RECOVER – to CKA_SIGN_RECOVER of the private key
#. CKA_WRAP – to CKA_UNWRAP of the private key
#. CKA_DERIVE – to CKA_DERIVE of the private key
#. CKA_ID – copy from private key
#. CKA_START_DATE – copy from private key
#. CKA_END_DATE – copy from private key
#. CKA_SUBJECT – copy from private key
#. CKA_PUBLIC_KEY_INFO – copy from private key
#. CKA_KEY_GEN_MECHANISM – copy from private key
#. CKA_ALLOWED_MECHANISMS – copy from private key
#. CKA_TRUSTED – copy from private key

This mechanism should be supported for all private key types supported by the
token.
