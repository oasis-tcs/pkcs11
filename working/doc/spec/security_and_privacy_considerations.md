# Appendix B. Security and Privacy Considerations

==[Optional section.]==

==Note: OASIS strongly recommends that Technical Committees consider issues that might affect safety, security, privacy, and/or data protection in implementations of their work products and document these for implementers and adopters. For some purposes, you may find it required, e.g. if you apply for IANA registration.==

==While it may not be immediately obvious how your work product might make systems vulnerable to attack, most work products, because they involve communications between systems, message formats, or system settings, open potential channels for exploit. For example, IETF [RFC 3552] lists “eavesdropping, replay, message insertion, deletion, modification, and man-in-the-middle” as well as potential denial of service attacks as threats that must be considered and, if appropriate, addressed in IETF RFCs.==

==In addition to considering and describing foreseeable risks, this section should include guidance on how implementers and adopters can protect against these risks.==

==We encourage editors and TC members concerned with this subject to read Guidelines for Writing RFC Text on Security Considerations, IETF [RFC 3552], for more information.==
