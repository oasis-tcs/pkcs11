### Definitions

This section defines the key type “**CKK_SHA512_224_HMAC**” for type CK_KEY_TYPE
as used in the **CKA_KEY_TYPE** attribute of key objects.

Mechanisms:

- CKM_SHA512_224
- CKM_SHA512_224_HMAC
- CKM_SHA512_224_HMAC_GENERAL
- CKM_SHA512_224_KEY_DERIVATION
- CKM_SHA512_224_KEY_GEN 

### SHA-512/224 digest

The SHA-512/224 mechanism, denoted **CKM_SHA512_224**, is a mechanism for
message digesting, following the Secure Hash Algorithm defined in [FIPS PUB
180-4], section 5.3.6. It is based on a 512-bit message digest with a distinct
initial hash value and truncated to 224 bits. **CKM_SHA512_224** is the same as
**CKM_SHA512_T** with a parameter value of 224.

It does not have a parameter.

Constraints on the length of input and output data are summarized in the
following table. For single-part digesting, the data and the digest may begin at
the same location in memory.

| Function | Input length | Digest length |
|----------|--------------|---------------|
| C_Digest | any          | 28            |

### General-length SHA-512/224-HMAC

The general-length SHA-512/224-HMAC mechanism, denoted
**CKM_SHA512_224_HMAC_GENERAL**, is the same as the general-length SHA-1-HMAC
mechanism in section 6.19.3, except that it uses the HMAC construction based on
the SHA-512/224 hash function and length of the output should be in the range
1-28. The keys it uses are generic secret keys and **CKK_SHA512_224_HMAC**.
FIPS-198 compliant tokens may require the key length to be at least 14 bytes;
that is, half the size of the SHA-512/224 hash output.

It has a parameter, a **CK_MAC_GENERAL_PARAMS**, which holds the length in bytes
of the desired output. This length should be in the range 0-28 (the output size
of SHA-512/224 is 28 bytes). FIPS-198 compliant tokens may constrain the output
length to be at least 4 or 14 (half the maximum length). Signatures (MACs)
produced by this mechanism will be taken from the start of the full 28-byte HMAC
output.

| Function | Key type       | Data length | Signature length              |
|----------|----------------|-------------|-------------------------------|
| C_Sign   | generic secret CKK_SHA512_224_HMAC | Any | 1-28, depending on parameters |
| C_Verify | generic secret CKK_SHA521_224_HMAC | Any | 1-28, depending on parameters |

### SHA-512/224-HMAC

The SHA-512-HMAC mechanism, denoted **CKM_SHA512_224_HMAC**, is a special case
of the general-length SHA-512/224-HMAC mechanism.

It has no parameter, and always produces an output of length 28.

### SHA-512/224 key derivation

The SHA-512/224 key derivation, denoted **CKM_SHA512_224_KEY_DERIVATION**, is
the same as the SHA-512 key derivation mechanism in section [6.23.5], except that
it uses the SHA-512/224 hash function and the relevant length is 28 bytes.

### SHA-512/224 HMAC key generation

The SHA-512/224-HMAC key generation mechanism, denoted
**CKM_SHA512_224_KEY_GEN**, is a key generation mechanism for NIST’s
SHA512/224-HMAC.

It does not have a parameter.

The mechanism generates SHA512/224-HMAC keys with a particular length in bytes,
as specified in the **CKA_VALUE_LEN** attribute of the template for the key.

The mechanism contributes the **CKA_CLASS**, **CKA_KEY_TYPE**, and **CKA_VALUE**
attributes to the new key. Other attributes supported by the SHA512/224-HMAC key
type (specifically, the flags indicating which functions the key supports) may
be specified in the template for the key, or else are assigned default initial
values.

For this mechanism, the _ulMinKeySize_ and _ulMaxKeySize_ fields of the
**CK_MECHANISM_INFO** structure specify the supported range of
**CKM_SHA512_224_HMAC** key sizes, in bytes.
