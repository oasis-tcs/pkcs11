### Definitions

Mechanisms:

- CKM_SHA3_512
- CKM_SHA3_512_HMAC
- CKM_SHA3_512_HMAC_GENERAL
- CKM_SHA3_512_KEY_DERIVATION
- CKM_SHA3_512_KEY_GEN

### SHA3-512 digest

The SHA3-512 mechanism, denoted **CKM_SHA3_512**, is a mechanism for message
digesting, following the Secure Hash 3 Algorithm with a 512-bit message digest
defined in [FIPS PUB 202].

It does not have a parameter.

Constraints on the length of input and output data are summarized in the
following table. For single-part digesting, the data and the digest may begin at
the same location in memory.

| Function | Input length | Digest length |
|----------|--------------|---------------|
| C_Digest | any          | 64            |
table: SHA3-512: Data Length

### General-length SHA3-512-HMAC

The general-length SHA3-512-HMAC mechanism, denoted
**CKM_SHA3_512_HMAC_GENERAL**, is the same as the general-length SHA-1-HMAC
mechanism in section 6.19.4, except that it uses the HMAC construction based on
the SHA3-512 hash function and length of the output should be in the range
1-64.The keys it uses are generic secret keys and **CKK_SHA3_512_HMAC**.
FIPS-198 compliant tokens may require the key length to be at least 32 bytes;
that is, half the size of the SHA3-512 hash output.

It has a parameter, a **CK_MAC_GENERAL_PARAMS**, which holds the length in bytes
of the desired output. This length should be in the range 1-64 (the output size
of SHA3-512 is 64 bytes). FIPS-198 compliant tokens may constrain the output
length to be at least 4 or 32 (half the maximum length). Signatures (MACs)
produced by this mechanism shall be taken from the start of the full 64-byte
HMAC output.

| Function | Key type       | Data length | Signature length              |
|----------|----------------|-------------|-------------------------------|
| C_Sign   | generic secret CKK_SHA3_512_HMAC | Any | 1-64, depending on parameters |
| C_Verify | generic secret CKK_SHA3_512_HMAC | Any | 1-64, depending on parameters |

### SHA3-512-HMAC

The SHA3-512-HMAC mechanism, denoted **CKM_SHA3_512_HMAC**, is a special case of
the general-length SHA3-512-HMAC mechanism.

It has no parameter, and always produces an output of length 64.

### SHA3-512 key derivation

SHA3-512 key derivation, denoted **CKM_SHA3_512_KEY_DERIVATION**, is the same as
the SHA-1 key derivation mechanism in section 6.19.5, except that it uses the
SHA-512 hash function and the relevant length is 64 bytes. 

### SHA3-512 HMAC key generation

The SHA3-512-HMAC key generation mechanism, denoted **CKM_SHA3_512_KEY_GEN**, is
a key generation mechanism for NIST’s SHA3-512-HMAC.

It does not have a parameter.

The mechanism generates SHA3-512-HMAC keys with a particular length in bytes, as
specified in the **CKA_VALUE_LEN** attribute of the template for the key.

The mechanism contributes the **CKA_CLASS**, **CKA_KEY_TYPE**, and **CKA_VALUE**
attributes to the new key. Other attributes supported by the SHA3-512-HMAC key
type (specifically, the flags indicating which functions the key supports) may
be specified in the template for the key, or else are assigned default initial
values.

For this mechanism, the _ulMinKeySize_ and _ulMaxKeySize_ fields of the
**CK_MECHANISM_INFO** structure specify the supported range of
**CKM_SHA3_512_HMAC** key sizes, in bytes.
